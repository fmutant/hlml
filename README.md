vectorized high-level math library

i started this piece of software after reading http://www.codersnotes.com/notes/maths-lib-2016/ and you should too.

it's x64 SSE4.1(ish) compatible (which is suppported by every Intel since 2008 and every AMD since 2012) but no NEON or AltiVec at the moment.

list of resources that might come handy in case you'd like to add or remove something:
